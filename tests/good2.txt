"""QUESTION"""
You are designing a distributed system that processes large batches of sensor data coming from thousands of IoT devices. 
Each device sends data every 5 seconds, and the system must maintain both fault tolerance and high throughput. 
To handle peak loads, you consider four architectural approaches. 
Each approach differs in message queue structure, replication strategy, 
failure recovery time, and scaling method. 
Your task is to choose the architecture that provides the best combination 
of horizontal scalability, minimal message loss during node failures, 
and efficient load redistribution across worker nodes when demand spikes unexpectedly.
"""CHOICES"""
A: A single central message queue with periodic snapshotting, 
   manual scaling of worker nodes, and synchronous replication across two regions.
B: A multi-stage pipeline using independent queues per processing stage, 
   with asynchronous replication, automatic scaling rules triggered by CPU usage, 
   and fallback spill-to-disk buffering during bursts.
C: A distributed event-streaming platform with partitioned topics, 
   replication factor 3 across availability zones, 
   consumer groups for parallel processing, 
   and elastic autoscaling triggered by partition lag.
D: A hybrid batch-stream model that stores incoming data in large write-ahead logs, 
   then processes them in micro-batches, 
   with replication only at checkpoint intervals and static worker allocation.
